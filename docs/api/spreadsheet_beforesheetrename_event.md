# beforeSheetRename

:::caution
The **beforeSheetRename** event has been deprecated in v4.3. The event will continue work, but you'd better apply a new approach:

~~~js
spreadsheet.events.on("beforeAction", (actionName, config) => {
    if (actionName === "renameSheet") {
        console.log(actionName, config);
        return false;
    }
});
~~~

For more details about the new concept, see **[Spreadsheet actions](api/overview/actions_overview.md)**.

### Description

@short: Fires before a sheet is renamed

### Usage

~~~jsx
beforeSheetRename: (sheet: object, value: string) => void | boolean;
~~~

### Parameters

The callback of the event takes the following parameters:

- `sheet` - (required) an object with the old name of a sheet and its id
- `value` - (required) the new name of the sheet

### Returns

Return `true` to rename a sheet, `false` to prevent the sheet from being renamed

### Example

~~~jsx {5-9}
const spreadsheet = new dhx.Spreadsheet("spreadsheet", {
    // config parameters
});
// subscribe on the "beforeSheetRename" event
spreadsheet.events.on("beforeSheetRename", function(sheet, value) {
    console.log("The ", sheet.name, "sheet will be renamed to ", value);
    console.log(sheet, value);
    return true;
});
