# afterRowAdd

:::caution
The **afterRowAdd** event has been deprecated in v4.3. The event will continue work, but you'd better apply a new approach:

~~~jsx
spreadsheet.events.on("afterAction", (actionName, config) => {
    if (actionName === "addRow") {
        console.log(actionName, config);
    }
});
~~~

For more details about the new concept, see **[Spreadsheet actions](api/overview/actions_overview.md)**.
