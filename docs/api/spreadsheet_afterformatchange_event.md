# afterFormatChange

:::caution
The **afterFormatChange** event has been deprecated in v4.3. The event will continue work, but you'd better apply a new approach:

~~~jsx
spreadsheet.events.on("afterAction", (actionName, config) => {
    if (actionName === "setCellFormat") {
        console.log(actionName, config);
    }
});
~~~

For more details about the new concept, see **[Spreadsheet actions](api/overview/actions_overview.md)**. 
:::

### Description

@short: Fires after the format of a cell is changed

### Usage

~~~jsx
afterFormatChange: (cell: string, format: string) => void;
~~~

### Parameters

The callback of the event takes the following parameters:

- `cell` - (required) the id of a cell
- `format` - (required) a new format applied for a cell

### Example

~~~jsx {5-8}
const spreadsheet = new dhx.Spreadsheet("spreadsheet", {});
spreadsheet.parse(data);

// subscribe on the "afterFormatChange" event
spreadsheet.events.on("afterFormatChange", function(cell, format){
    console.log("Format of cell "+spreadsheet.selection.getSelectedCell()+" has changed");
    console.log(cell, format);
});
