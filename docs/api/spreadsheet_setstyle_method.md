# setStyle()

### Description

@short: Sets style to a cell(s)

:::info
The method allows setting the same style for the specified cells. In case you want to apply different cells to spreadsheet cells, you'd better use the [](api/spreadsheet_parse_method.md) method.
:::

### Usage

~~~jsx
setStyle(cell: string, styles: array | object): void;
~~~

### Parameters

- `cell` -  (required) the id(s) of a cell(s) or a range of cells
- `style` - (required) styles that should be applied to cells

### Example

~~~jsx {5,8,11,14}
const spreadsheet = new dhx.Spreadsheet("spreadsheet", {
    // config parameters
});
// setting style for one cell
spreadsheet.setStyle("A1",{background:"red", border:"solid 1px yellow"});

// setting the same style for a range of cells
spreadsheet.setStyle("A1:D1",{color:"blue"});

// setting the same style for different cells
spreadsheet.setStyle("B6,A1:D1",{color:"blue"});

// setting styles from an array for cells in a range alternately
spreadsheet.setStyle("A1:D1",[{color:"blue"},{color:"red"}]);
~~~

:::info
Starting with v4.1, the reference to a cell or range of cells can be specified in the following format:

~~~js
spreadsheet.setStyle("sheet1!A2", {background:"red", border:"solid 1px yellow"}); 
~~~

where *sheet1* is the name of the tab.

In case the name of the tab isn't specified, the method will apply the style to the cell(s) of the active tab.
