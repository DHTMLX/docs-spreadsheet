# afterSheetAdd

:::caution
The **afterSheetAdd** event has been deprecated in v4.3. The event will continue work, but you'd better apply a new approach:

~~~js
spreadsheet.events.on("afterAction", (actionName, config) => {
    if (actionName === "addSheet") {
        console.log(actionName, config);
    }
});
~~~

For more details about the new concept, see **[Spreadsheet actions](api/overview/actions_overview.md)**. 
:::

### Description

@short: Fires after a new sheet is added

### Usage

~~~jsx
afterSheetAdd: (sheet: object) => void;
~~~

### Parameters

The callback of the event takes the following parameters:

- `sheet` - (required) an object with the name and id of a new sheet

### Example

~~~jsx {5-8}
const spreadsheet = new dhx.Spreadsheet("spreadsheet", {
    // config parameters
});
// subscribe on the "afterSheetAdd" event
spreadsheet.events.on("afterSheetAdd", function(sheet) {
    console.log("A new sheet is added:", sheet.name);
    console.log(sheet);
});
