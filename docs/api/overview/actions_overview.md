# Actions overview

This section is dedicated to a new conception of interaction with Spreadsheet events.

Starting from v4.3, DHTMLX Spreadsheet includes a pair of the [beforeAction](api/spreadsheet_beforeaction_event.md)/[afterAction](api/spreadsheet_afteraction_event.md) events that are intended to make your code simple and concise. They will fire right before an action is executed and indicate which exactly action has been performed.

~~~jsx
spreadsheet.events.on("beforeAction", (actionName, config) => {
    if (actionName === "addColumn") {
        console.log(actionName, config);
        return false;
    },
    // more actions
});

spreadsheet.events.on("afterAction", (actionName, config) => {
    if (actionName === "addColumn") {
        console.log(actionName, config)
    },
    // more actions
});
~~~

[The full list of the available actions is given below.](#list-of-actions)

>It means, that you don't have to constantly add sets of paired [**before-** and **after-**](api/overview/events_overview.md) events anymore to track and handle the actions which you execute when changing something in the spreadsheet. 

>But if needed you can use an **old approach** because all the existing events will continue work as before:
~~~jsx
spreadsheet.events.on("afterColumnAdd", function(cell){
    console.log("A new column is added", cell);
});
~~~
~~~jsx
spreadsheet.events.on("beforeColumnAdd", function(cell){
    console.log("A new column will be added", cell);
    return true;
});
