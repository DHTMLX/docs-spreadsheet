What you can do:

- change the color of a text and its background via color picker linked to the **Text color** button
- change the color of text background via color picker linked to the **Background color** button
- apply *Bold*, *Italic* and *Underline* styles to a text

## Alignment

You can use the corresponding toolbar controls to align data in a cell horizontally or (and) vertically.

Click the "Horizontal align" button to align data along the left/right edges of a cell, or in its center.
