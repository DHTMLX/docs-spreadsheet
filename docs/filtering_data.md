# Filtering data

You may filter data in the spreadsheet to show only the records that meet the criteria you specify.

To activate the filtering functionality, you can use either of two ways:

- Set focus on a cell or select a range of cells and click the **Filter** button in the toolbar

After that, a **filter** icon appears on the right side of the header of each column in the range. 

## Filtering by condition

- Click the **filter** icon of the necessary column

- Specify the filter criterion and click **Apply**
